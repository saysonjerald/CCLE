## How to use (First time use only)

1. Open command line and and paste this code below, then hit enter.

5. Go to drive C: and make a folder called 'data' and create another folder called 'db' inside that data folder
    ````console 
    C:\data\db
    ````
    
6. In order to run the local server you must run 'mongod.exe'
    ````console 
    C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4\bin\mongod.exe
